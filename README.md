# How to use Github

Right before you start working, run this in Git Bash:

```sh
git fetch && git pull
```

---

Save the changes you make and make sure you're in the `pale-knight-foundry (master)` directory.

Then run this:

```sh
git add . && git commit -m "title"
```

`title` describes what you just did (in the present tense). It could be something like `"add icons"`.

---

Then run:

```sh
git push
```

and it should show up in Github!
